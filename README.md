Game Design Document (Revised)
Game Overview
The game revolves around elemental abilities and strategic combat, where players are assigned a pool of abilities at the start of the game. Each ability is tied to a specific element (such as Fire, Water, Earth, and Air), and each element has its own unique set of skills and a powerful ultimate ability. Players will engage in combat across multiple rounds, with a final showdown where they must strategically choose which two abilities to combine and use.
Game Objective
The objective of the game is to defeat the opposing player in a series of combat rounds. After each death, players will be assigned new sets of abilities, but in the final round, players will have the opportunity to select which two of their accumulated abilities to use, with full access to all the skills and one ultimate from each ability.
Core Gameplay Mechanics
Ability Randomization (Round 1 and Round 2):
At the start of the game, players are randomly assigned 4 abilities from a pool of 10 possible elemental abilities. Each ability consists of:
4 regular skills (e.g., Fireball, Flame Shield, etc.)
1 ultimate ability (e.g., Inferno for Fire, Landslide for Earth)
Abilities are not fixed and can be repeated—meaning, a player could potentially have two identical abilities in their pool (e.g., two Fire abilities).
Players can use all regular skills of both assigned abilities during the first and second rounds.
Players can use their ultimate ability, but the ultimate has a shared cooldown between both abilities.
Final Round – Ability Selection (Round 3):
After dying twice, players enter the final round, where they must choose 2 abilities from the 4 they’ve accumulated.
Example: If a player received Fire, Water, Earth, and Air, they will choose Fire and Earth to use in the final round.
The player now has access to all skills from the Fire and Earth abilities:
Fire: Fireball, Flame Shield, Flame Dash, Inferno (Ultimate)
Earth: Stone Fist, Earthquake, Rock Armor, Landslide (Ultimate)
Players can only use one ultimate in the final round, but they have access to all regular skills from both selected abilities.
Ultimate Limitation:
Even though players select 2 abilities, they are limited to using one ultimate per round. This is due to the shared cooldown between both ultimates, requiring players to choose strategically which ultimate to use.

Combat System
Rounds:
The game is played in multiple rounds, each round consisting of combat between two players. The goal is to eliminate the opponent by using their abilities and avoiding damage.
Players start with 2 abilities (randomly assigned) and can use them freely during the first two rounds.
After dying twice, players enter the final round and must select 2 out of their 4 abilities to use in the third and final round.
Final Life:
In the final life, players will have access to all of their regular abilities (the selected 2 abilities) and can only use one ultimate due to the shared cooldown.
Victory Conditions:
The player who successfully eliminates the opponent in the final round wins the match.
Balancing and Fairness
Element Synergy:
Some elements may synergize well with others, while others could counteract each other. For example:
Water can put out Fire, but Fire can evaporate Water.
Earth might have high defense, while Air could have high mobility.
Ultimate Balancing:
Each ultimate is designed to be useful in specific scenarios, but the ultimate selection is intended to prevent players from having overwhelming power. Players need to choose carefully which ultimate will benefit them most in the final round.
Ability Rarity and Strength:
The rarity of each ability will be considered to ensure that no player has an unfair advantage based solely on randomization. Higher rarity abilities may have slightly more powerful skills or faster cooldowns.
Game Flow and User Experience
Game Start:
Players will see an intro screen that explains the mechanics of the game (the abilities, ultimate selection, etc.).
Once the game starts, the abilities for both players will be randomly selected.
During Combat:
Players engage in combat, utilizing their assigned abilities.
The game will display ability cooldowns, ultimate readiness, and health bars clearly to ensure players can make informed decisions.
Final Life:
After two deaths, players will be prompted to select their two final abilities from the 4 they’ve been given. Once selected, they can use all the abilities from the chosen elements but can only use one ultimate.
Victory Screen:
The match ends when one player defeats the other in the final life, displaying a victory screen with the winner’s name and the abilities they used.
Possible Adjustments and Future Features
Customization:
Allow players to customize their appearance with skins, or provide a progression system where abilities can be upgraded.
Multiplayer:
This system could easily scale to support multiplayer combat where teams of players are assigned different combinations of abilities.
Additional Abilities:
New abilities could be added over time to create even more combinations and strategic depth.
